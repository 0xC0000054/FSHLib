# FSHLib

This is the reverse-engineered code of the FSHLib library written by Jon Rista a.k.a DarkMatter.
I patched it in 2009 to fix a compatibility issue with Windows Vista.

FSHLib appears to be based on Denis Auroux's [FSHTool](https://math.mit.edu/~auroux/software/index.html).

## .NET Framework version 1.1

The `dotnet_1_1` folder contains two text files with the debug and release build commands for the .NET 1.1 C# compiler.   
This can be used to compile a version of the library that is compatible with SC4Tool, and other tools that are built with .NET 1.1.

## Visual Studio

The `vs` folder contains a project file for Visual Studio 2022, this is to make it easier to examine the code.
